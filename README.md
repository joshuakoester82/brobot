# BroBot v 0.1

Developed by: Joshua D. Koester. 2019

BroBot is a Discord bot being developed exclusively for the GameBros Discord server.
The bot is written using the discord.py rewrite, and is one of my first python projects. 
As such it is likely highly flawed and full of garbage code. But building your way forward
is the only way to grow. BroBot exists mostly as a way for me to get practical python experience and hopefully, 
one day, land a job. He is a work in progress, and will likely be updated to accomodate specific server needs.
